libcas provides a C API to the CAS1 and CAS2 (2011-06-20) protocols.

Compilation and install is as expected:
./configure && make && make install

However, it is *strongly* recommended to do out-of-directory building:
mkdir ../libcas-build && cd ../libcas-build && ../libcas/configure && make && make install

This will install libcas in /usr/local/lib and clicas in /usr/local/bin .

Note that tests can be run using "make check", but require "nc" and "openssl" command line
	utilities to be installed.
	
Examples can be found in the /examples directory of the distribution.
